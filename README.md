# CodeBuilder
=============

CodeBuilder started out as an exercise learning about Swift function builders. It was slowly iterated on with the intention of wirting code that creates Swift code.

## Installation
### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

```swift
dependencies: [
     .package(url: "https://github.com/hooliooo/CodeBuilder", from: "0.1.0")
]
```
